# a_sync
An async helper library for Python's async functionality.

# Under construction
The repo is "under construction" - it serves at the moment as a place to put the project and "get it out there", but there are a lot of project-management tasks to do, including getting a sensible README up.

# Alpha status
The repo is definitely "alpha".  Possibly "pre-alpha", if that's a thing.  At the moment it's got one internal user for code that isn't even published internally yet.

Basically anything is subject to change.  This includes any of the API, the project name, and even the project's existence.  It was initially created to help me understand how Python's async stuff worked, and has grown as I've decided that the asyncio lib is lower-level than I want to deal with, and as I explored different "well now how do I do this?" questions.

Feedback, new issues, suggestions, criticisms, etc are welcomed and encouraged.  If the project turns out to be truly worth it, I'll be happy to have shared it.  If not, I'll be happy to have learned why it's not, and how to do async in python better.
